**UI Enhancement Prompt (For Design LLM):**

> Revise the UI of this personal brand site with the following goals:
>
> 1. **Elegance & Gravitas:** Reflect spiritual depth, masculine maturity, and tech clarity — a blend of stoic architecture, calm typography, and symbolic imagery.
> 2. **Visual Tension Between Strength & Stillness:** Mix minimalist layout with subtle animated transitions (e.g., arch appearing, gold halo glow on hover, cross fade-ins).
> 3. **Typography Hierarchy:** Use bold Montserrat headers paired with soft Lora quotes. Establish authority but maintain warmth.
> 4. **Bridge Motif:** Use architectural bridge forms in background sections, subtly layered — as metaphors, not just graphics.
> 5. **User Experience Priority:**
>
>    * Visitors should *feel peace + clarity* when landing
>    * Navigation should be scroll-based, intuitive, and immersive
>    * Embed "Frameworks & Fire" posts as animated, swipeable cards
>    * Make the "Walk the Bridge With Me" CTA a light gold hoverable button that gently pulses
> 6. **Photo Integration:** Integrate one stoic portrait (olive shirt, minimal background) in hero or bio section, with short caption: *"Disciplined by design. Guided by faith."*
> 7. **Responsive Layout:** Prioritize mobile elegance — spacing, font sizes, and call-to-actions should feel inviting on phone and tablet
