Here are some of the most common amethyst commands I've been using for managing my windows.

[Full documentation here](https://ianyh.com/amethyst/)

Option + Shift + K > to navigate between all my active windows on Mac.

CMD + D > to expand into full screen the current active window (useful when you have more than 1 window ataking up screen space)

And my favorite (not really an Amethyst command) is CMD + tab

Cheers
