Here are my notes taken while reading [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://milkov.tech/assets/psd.pdf) by John Ousterhout.



A shallow module is one whose interface is complicated relative to the
functionality it provides. Shallow modules don’t help much in the battle
against complexity, because the benefit they provide (not having to learn about
how they work internally) is negated by the cost of learning and using their
interfaces. Small modules tend to be shallow.


### On Clasitis
Unfortunately, the value of deep classes is not widely appreciated today. The
conventional wisdom in programming is that classes should be small, not deep.
Students are often taught that the most important thing in class design is to break
up larger classes into smaller ones. The same advice is often given about
methods: “Any method longer than N lines should be divided into multiple
methods” (N can be as low as 10). This approach results in large numbers of
shallow classes and methods, which add to overall system complexity.

^^ I personally experienced this first hand when I started learning coding. A friend of mine 
spoke to me about making sure React files were never greater than 150 lines in length & this was the first
of where I bought into the dogma of small classes. Would be interested to take a look at the 
source code for Java's garbage collector & the UNIX file system, both examples from Ousterhout on deep modules. 

### Information Leakage
One of the best skills you can learn as a software designer is a high level
of sensitivity to information leakage. If you encounter information leakage
between classes, ask yourself “How can I reorganize these classes so that this
particular piece of knowledge only affects a single class?” If the affected classes
are relatively small and closely tied to the leaked information, it may make sense
to merge them into a single class. A


Example: 
5.5 Example: too many classes
The most common mistake made by students was to divide their code into a large
number of shallow classes, which led to information leakage between the classes.
One team used two different classes for receiving HTTP requests; the first class
read the request from the network connection into a string, and the second class
parsed the string. This is an example of a temporal decomposition (“first we read
the request, then we parse it”). Information leakage occurred because an HTTP
request can’t be read without parsing much of the message; for example, the
Content-Length header specifies the length of the request body, so the headers
must be parsed in order to compute the total request length. As a result, both
classes needed to understand most of the structure of HTTP requests, and parsing
code was duplicated in both classes. This approach also created extra complexity
for callers, who had to invoke two methods in different classes, in a particular
order, to receive a request.
Because the classes shared so much information, it would have been better to
merge them into a single class that handles both request reading and parsing.
This provides better information hiding, since it isolates all knowledge of the
request format in one class, and it also provides a simpler interface to callers (just
one method to invoke).
This example illustrates a general theme in software design: information
hiding can often be improved by making a class slightly larger.


When decomposing a system into modules, try not to be influenced by the
order in which operations will occur at runtime; that will lead you down the path
of temporal decomposition, which will result in information leakage and shallow
modules. Instead, think about the different pieces of knowledge that are needed
to carry out the tasks of your application, and design each module to encapsulate
one or a few of those pieces of knowledge. This will produce a clean and simple
design with deep modules.



### Make classes somewhat general-purpose
In my experience, the sweet spot is to implement new modules in a somewhat
general-purpose fashion. The phrase “somewhat general-purpose” means that
the module’s functionality should reflect your current needs, but its interface
should not. Instead, the interface should be general enough to support multiple
uses


### Red Flag: Pass-Through Method
A pass-through method is one that does nothing except pass its arguments to
another method, usually with the same API as the pass-through method. This
typically indicates that there is not a clean division of responsibility between
the classes.


## Dispatcher

One example where it’s useful for a method to call another method with the
same signature is a dispatcher. A dispatcher is a method that uses its arguments
to select one of several other methods to invoke; then it passes most or all of its
arguments to the chosen method.

## Decorator Pattern

A decorator object takes an existing object and
extends its functionality; it provides an API similar or identical to the underlying
object, and its methods invoke the methods of the underlying object.

Another example occurs in
windowing systems: a Window class implements a simple form of window that is
not scrollable, and a ScrollableWindow class decorates the Window class by
adding horizontal and vertical scrollbars.
The motivation for decorators is to separate special-purpose extensions of a
class from a more generic core. However, decorator classes tend to be shallow:
they introduce a large amount of boilerplate for a small amount of new
functionality. Decorator classes often contain many pass-through methods



### Pass through variables

Alternatives: 
The solution I use most often is to introduce a context object as in Figure
7.2(d). A context stores all of the application’s global state (anything that would
otherwise be a pass-through variable or global variable). Most applications have
multiple variables in their global state, representing things such as configuration
options, shared subsystems, and performance counters. There is one context
object per instance of the system. The context allows multiple instances of the
system to coexist in a single process, each with its own context.
